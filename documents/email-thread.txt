Subject: HVAC Installation Schedule Confirmation

Hi,

Just wanted to confirm we're still on track for the rooftop unit installation
starting this Wednesday. Our production team has scheduled downtime for
Wednesday through Friday specifically for this project.

Please confirm the crew will arrive at 7 AM as discussed.

Thanks,
Mike Torres
Facilities Manager

Mike,

I need to let you know we've hit an unexpected delay. The crane rental company
double-booked our equipment, and the earliest availability is now next Monday.

I understand this is frustrating given your production schedule. We're actively
looking for alternative crane providers.

I'll update you tomorrow with options.

Best,
[Your Name]

This is really disappointing. We've had 47 employees sitting idle since 7 AM
waiting for your crew. That's over $4,000 in wasted labor costs already this morning,
not counting the lost production.

I specifically confirmed this timeline THREE times over the past two weeks.
Our CFO is asking questions and I don't have good answers.

What exactly are our options here? When can you GUARANTEE the work will be done?
We cannot afford another false start.

Mike
